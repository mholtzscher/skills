# Domain modeling

Actively build and sharpen the project's domain model as you design. This is the _active_ discipline: challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and decisions down the moment they crystallise.

Use `question` for genuine domain decisions, with conversational fallback. Reuse settled answers from planning. The inline documentation updates below apply when the requested work includes modeling; in a read-only investigation, propose them instead. Preserve established repository organization and numbering, and record the decision's actual status.

## File structure

Most repos have a single context:

```
/
├── GLOSSARY.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

If a `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. The map points to where each one lives:

```
/
├── GLOSSARY-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
├── src/
│   ├── ordering/
│   │   ├── GLOSSARY.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/                 ← context-specific decisions
│   └── billing/
│       ├── GLOSSARY.md
│       └── docs/adr/
```

Create files lazily: only when you have something to write. If no `docs/adr/` exists, create it when the first ADR is needed.

### Single vs multi-context repos

Infer the structure:

- If `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` exists, read it to find contexts
- If only a root `GLOSSARY.md` exists, single context
- If neither exists, create a root `GLOSSARY.md` lazily when the first term is resolved

When multiple contexts exist, infer which one the current topic relates to. If unclear, ask.

When writing or updating `GLOSSARY-MAP.md`, read [GLOSSARY-MAP-FORMAT.md](references/GLOSSARY-MAP-FORMAT.md).

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `GLOSSARY.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y. Which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account': do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, invent specific edge-case scenarios that force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible. Which is right?"

### Update GLOSSARY.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `GLOSSARY.md` right there. Don't batch these up: capture them as they happen. Use the format in [GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md](references/GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md).

`GLOSSARY.md` should be totally devoid of implementation details. Do not treat `GLOSSARY.md` as a spec, a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse**: the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context**: a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off**: there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR. Use the format in [ADR-FORMAT.md](references/ADR-FORMAT.md).
